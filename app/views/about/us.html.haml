        Our Mission

      %p
        Startups are hard, and they require resilience and
        determination. If they were easy, everyone would be starting
        one. Since there aren't that many of us crazy enough to take on
        this huge challenge, we need to band together.

      %p
        Startup Victoria is all about helping you find the other people
        around you who are fighting the good fight as well. It's a place
        to celebrate your wins, commiserate over struggles and push each
        other further along the path to success.

      %p
        We all need a support team to help us keep going when times are
        tough, and startup founders are no different. Startup Victoria is
        the place to find resources to guide you and people to inspire
        you on your Startup journey.
